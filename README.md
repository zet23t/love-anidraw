This (abandoned) project is a painting application for windows ink driven painting. 
It records the sequence of drawings, which allows creating images that are drawn in fast paced fashion. 
Pauses in drawing are reduced to a fraction of a second and a general speedup helps to keep the animation snappy.

I discontinued this because it didn't satisfy my needs while become more and more complicated in the process.
